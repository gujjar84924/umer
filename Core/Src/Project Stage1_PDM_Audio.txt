Project: Stage1_PDM_Audio
Target: STM32H723ZGTx

Features:
- Captures audio from 4 PDM microphones via SAI1
- Converts to PCM using PDM2PCM library
- Logs Mic1 audio to SD card as log.txt
- Sample rate: 48kHz, 128 samples per frame

Included:
- Stage1_PDM_Audio.hex   --> Flash this to your board
- Stage1_PDM_Audio.ioc   --> (Optional) View project config in STM32CubeMX

Instructions:
1. Flash firmware to STM32H723ZG board using STM32CubeProgrammer:
   - Connect the board via USB or ST-Link
   - Open STM32CubeProgrammer
   - Click “Connect”
   - Click “Open File” and select `Stage1_PDM_Audio.hex`
   - Click “Start Programming”

2. Insert a microSD card (FAT32 formatted) into the board.

3. Reset the board. A file called `log.txt` will be created.

4. Remove the SD card and open `log.txt` to view raw PCM data from Mic1.
